## Installation

```bash
yarn rebuild
```

## Get started

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=***** yarn dev
```

In a separate terminal window run
```bash
yarn poll-spotify
```

Open up `/common/constants/authorization.js` and change the variables in that file to match your Philips and Spotify config. Note that the `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` variable MUST be passed to your app as an environment variable.
If you don't already have a Spotify developer account you can get one here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications

Open up `AlbumContainer.js`. You'll see a lines like

```javascript
const numberOfColors = 4;
const lampIds = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

Edit these to your preference.

`numberOfColors` determines how many colors to pull out of the album art.

`lampIds` is the array of Philips Hue Lamp ids. Add up to four ids to this array. The order of the ids in this array is the order in which hues will be prioritized. This project will attempt to give higher priority to colors that "work well" with the range of colors that Philips Hue Lamps support. Typically such colors are as far from black or white as possible.
